                <p>
                  MyPerfectColor specializes in exact match paint color
                  solutions. We have matched thousands of colors for our
                  customers who range from homeowners all the way up to some of
                  the worldâ€™s leading brands like Boeing, Tiffany & Co., Kohler,
                  and the US Navy.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We have a database of over 250,000 colors that have been
                  previously matched, but for those customers who have a unique
                  product, color or material that they need to be converted into
                  the perfect paint color (or who need a sheen/finish matched on
                  a known color), we also offer a variety of Custom Color
                  Matching Services.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In these cases, we will often need you to send us a sample
                  (either a part, chip or other object). Once received, our
                  expert team will match the color and finish2 of your product
                  to your specifications, and mix and ship the perfectly matched
                  paint directly to you.
                </p>
                <h3>The Cost of Quality Color Matching</h3>
                <p>
                  Custom Color Matching incurs a one-time fee. Once your color
                  is in our database, that color will have its own dedicated web
                  page where you can reorder at any time without sending samples
                  or repaying the matching fee. This fee generally starts at
                  $175, but some specialty match situations can cost $400 or
                  more. Note that we generally waive Matching Fees when paint
                  purchases exceed a certain threshold.
